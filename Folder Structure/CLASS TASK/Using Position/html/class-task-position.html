                    There is a direct correlation between poor personal hygiene and illness. For this reason, it
                    iscritical that textile<br>
                    workers and other personnel understand and practice good basic hygiene habits, including proper
                    handwashing,<br>
                    on a regular basis. The FDA white paper (FDA 1999) cited poor personal hygiene and improper
                    handwashing as<br>
                    the third most important cause of illness. This report also cited that 93% of outbreaks related to
                    textile handlers<br>
                    involved sick workers. Problems associated with these outbreaks included poor personal hygiene,
                    poor<br>
                    handwashing, open sores, improper glove use, and eating while on the job.<br>

                    Textile workers are exposed to airborne particulate from natural and synthetic fibrous materials in
                    their work<br>
                    environment. Exposure to cotton dust in the textile industry has been associated with several
                    work-specific and<br>
                    non-specific respiratory symptoms. Cotton dust is often contaminated with Gram-negative bacteria,
                    which<br>
                    contain endotoxins (lipopolysaccharide) in their outer cell wall. Some studies suggested that
                    endotoxin is<br>
                    probably a major causative agent in the adverse pulmonary effects associated with organic dust
                    exposure.<br>
                    Endotoxin occurs abundantly in organic dust contaminated with animal faeces and plant materials.
                    Endotoxin is<br>
                    released into the air during cotton processing. Exposure to cotton dust and endotoxin has been
                    implicated in the<br>
                    aetiology of a number of diseases, including byssinosis, chronic bronchitis and chronic obstructive
                    pulmonary<br>
                    disease along with nasal and ocular irritation.<br>

                    clostridium tetani (the causative agent for tetanus), and coxiella burnetti (which causes Q fever).
                    Exposure to <br>
