            <span style="margin-left: 7%; padding-top:4px;">There is a direct correlation between poor personal hygiene
                and illness. For this reason, it iscritical that textile<br>
                workers and other personnel understand and practice good basic hygiene habits, including proper
                handwashing,<br>
                on a regular basis. The FDA white paper (FDA 1999) cited poor personal hygiene and improper handwashing
                as<br>
                the third most important cause of illness. This report also cited that 93% of outbreaks related to
                textile handlers<br>
                involved sick workers. Problems associated with these outbreaks included poor personal hygiene, poor<br>
                handwashing, open sores, improper glove use, and eating while on the job.

                Textile workers are exposed to airborne particulate from natural and synthetic fibrous materials in
                their work
                environment. Exposure to cotton dust in the textile industry has been associated with several
                work-specific and
                non-specific respiratory symptoms. Cotton dust is often contaminated with Gram-negative bacteria,
                which
                contain endotoxins (lipopolysaccharide) in their outer cell wall. Some studies suggested that
                endotoxin is
                probably a major causative agent in the adverse pulmonary effects associated with organic dust
                exposure.
                Endotoxin occurs abundantly in organic dust contaminated with animal faeces and plant materials.
                Endotoxin is
                released into the air during cotton processing. Exposure to cotton dust and endotoxin has been
                implicated in the
                aetiology of a number of diseases, including byssinosis, chronic bronchitis and chronic obstructive
                pulmonary
                disease along with nasal and ocular irritation.

                    In some activities, such as carding and willowing, workers may be exposed to biological agents such as anthrax,<br> 
                    clostridium tetani (the causative agent for tetanus), and coxiella burnetti (which causes Q fever). Exposure to <br> 
                    biological agents can result in allergies and respiratory disorders.
